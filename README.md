### What happened to 'Concrete'?

'Concrete' was a version of the long running Shopify Theme Framework, built on the now redundant [Shopify Slate](https://github.com/Shopify/slate).

The final version of 'Concrete' is considered v4 of the Shopify Theme Framework. You can find the legacy v4 code in [this release](https://github.com/Elkfox/Concrete/releases/tag/v4-alpha.1).

### A brief history of the Shopify Theme Framework

#### v0 - 2013

The Shopify Theme Framework was created in 2013, and based on the [Foundation](https://get.foundation/sites.html) front-end framework.

At that point there were no public frameworks available for building Shopify themes. You can find the original project [here](https://github.com/Cam/Shopify-Theme-Framework).

#### v1 (aka Forest) - c2014

v1 ('Forest') was a highly modified variation of Shopify's abandoned [Timber](https://github.com/Shopify/Timber) theme framework.

#### v2 - v4 (aka Concrete) - 2016 to 2020

Version 2 through 4 (known as 'Concrete') started life as a standalone framework and adopted [Slate](https://github.com/Shopify/slate) when released.

#### v5 & v6 (unreleased) - 2021

Version 5 was written from the ground up, and utlize [Shopify CLI](https://github.com/Shopify/cli) and [Parcel bundler](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) for hyper efficient Shopify theme development.

#### v6 - 2022 to 2023

We are working toward releasing a public version of version 6.
